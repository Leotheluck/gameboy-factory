                <p class="text">In 1989, "Ninpenbo" (copyrights, you know) was creating this very special gameboy. However, a problem occured! Japan moved from its original location by about 200 miles using very powerful boat propellers, leaving their factory on the water, which didn't discourage Ninpenbo, that continued to build its little console over the water</p>
                <p class="text">The GameBoy Factory is an open-source project consisting of a very lightweight file holding a very complex animated scene, which is the one you can see here, the scene also has OrbitControls and everything was set in a way that will allow me later to make it into a little game</p>
