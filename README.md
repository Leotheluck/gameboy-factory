# **Gameboy Factory `v1.0.0`**

Gameboy Factory is a completely `open-source` animated scene created using `THREE.js` and `Tween.js`.
It has been designed to be used on a local server since THREE.js needs it, I recommand you to use `MAMP` (you can also visit the GitHub link if you just want to explore).

## **Features**

* `New!` Fully animated cargo boats with containers taking in charge the final gameboy boxes
* `New!` Fully animated cranes conducting the boxes from the conveyor belt's end to the cargo boat (if there's one)
* `New!` Interactive information menu giving some informations as well as a lore about the project.
* Animated robot workers customizing the gameboys through the different steps of creation
* Animated conveyor belts following a precise timing and carrying the gameboys
* Completely custom gameboys with detailed components (battery, processor, screen, ...)
* Basic sound effects & background music to add immersion
* Customized FPS rate to match better performance (24 FPS)
* "Factory Machine", producing the gameboys at their first state
* Animated sea and factory base over this sea, creating an original landscape
* More 3D objects... (Workboxes, pillars, hedges, ...)
* Everything ^^^ has been created manually with JavaScript, `no model imported` !!!
